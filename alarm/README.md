# Simple Alarm Clock / Pizza Timer

This python script implements a simple alarm clock. It can be executed with the
following syntax:

    alarm TIME [TIME ...] [-- Your message]

It accepts multiple time descriptors which can add seconds, minutes or hours to
the alarm delay. The remaining time is displayed in your terminal.

To remind you of your pizza which is going to be ready in 18 minutes and 15
seconds you can execute the following command:

    alarm 18m 15s -- Take your vegetable out of the oven

You can change the source code to use your favorite alarm sound, media player
and message viewer.

The initial version of this pizza timer was written waiting for a pizza.
